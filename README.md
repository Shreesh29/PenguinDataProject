# PenguinDataProject
Predict Penguin Species using ML Tools 

#  The Objective

The purpose of this project is to use Logistic Regression, Deep Neural Network, and Support Vector Classifiers to predict penguin species given other information about the penguins. 

Twin objectives:

1. Accurate: achieve 100% prediction accuray

2. Efficient: use minimum parameters for training the model


# The Data Set

The data set contains details about 377 penguins from 3 species across 13 unique parameters, both qualitative and quantitative.

The 3 species are as listed:

1. Adelie
2. Chinstrap
3. Gentoo
